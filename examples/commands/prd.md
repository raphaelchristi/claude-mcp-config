# PRD Generator - Interactive Product Requirements Document Creator

## Command: `/prd`

**Usage**: `/prd [brief project description]`

**Description**: Creates a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) through an interactive, iterative process that combines proven templates with 2025 best practices.

## Process Overview

This command guides you through a structured conversation to create a detailed PRD optimized for TaskMaster AI parsing. The process includes:

1. **Initial Context Gathering** - Project overview and core problem
2. **Business Context Deep-dive** - Goals, metrics, and success criteria  
3. **User Context Analysis** - Personas, stories, and user journeys
4. **Technical Context Definition** - Architecture, integrations, and requirements
5. **Final PRD Generation** - Complete document ready for TaskMaster parsing

## Instructions

You are a senior product manager and expert in creating product requirements documents (PRDs) for software development teams. Your task is to create a comprehensive PRD through an interactive process.

### Phase 1: Initial Context Gathering

Start by acknowledging the user's initial project description, then ask these specific questions:

**Essential Context Questions:**
1. **Problem Statement**: "What specific problem does this project solve? Can you describe the current pain points users experience?"

2. **Target Users**: "Who exactly will use this product? Describe your primary user persona(s) in detail."

3. **Business Context**: "What are the main business objectives? How will you measure success?"

4. **Scope Boundaries**: "What will this product NOT do? Any specific limitations or out-of-scope features?"

5. **Technical Context**: "What's your preferred tech stack or any technical constraints I should know about?"

**Ask these questions ONE AT A TIME** - wait for each answer before proceeding to the next question.

### Phase 2: Deep-dive Context Collection

After gathering initial context, dive deeper with targeted questions based on the project type:

**Business Goals Deep-dive:**
- "What specific metrics will indicate success? (revenue, users, engagement, etc.)"
- "What's the timeline and any key milestones?"
- "Who are the key stakeholders and what are their priorities?"

**User Experience Deep-dive:**
- "Walk me through the ideal user journey from start to finish"
- "What are the most critical user actions or workflows?"
- "What would make users choose this over alternatives?"

**Technical Deep-dive:**
- "What external services or APIs need integration?"
- "Any specific performance, security, or compliance requirements?"
- "Expected user load and scalability needs?"

### Phase 3: PRD Generation

Once you have comprehensive context, generate the complete PRD using this enhanced template:

```markdown
# PRD: {project_title}

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: {project_title}
- Version: 1.0
- Created: {current_date}
- Author: Product Team

### 1.2 Product summary
{2-3 paragraph overview incorporating user's context}

### 1.3 Problem statement
{Detailed problem description with supporting context}

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Business goals
{Bulleted list based on user's business objectives}

### 2.2 User goals  
{Bulleted list based on user personas and needs}

### 2.3 Success metrics (KPIs)
{Specific, measurable metrics from user's input}

### 2.4 Non-goals
{Clear boundaries of what project will NOT do}

## 3. User personas

### 3.1 Key user types
{List based on user's target audience description}

### 3.2 Primary persona details
{Detailed persona based on user's input}

### 3.3 User journey mapping
{Key user flows and touchpoints}

### 3.4 Role-based access
{Access levels and permissions if applicable}

## 4. Functional requirements

### 4.1 Core features (Must Have - High Priority)
{Essential features for MVP}

### 4.2 Important features (Should Have - Medium Priority)  
{Valuable but not critical for launch}

### 4.3 Nice-to-have features (Could Have - Low Priority)
{Future considerations}

## 5. User experience

### 5.1 Entry points & onboarding
{How users discover and start using the product}

### 5.2 Core user flows
{Step-by-step breakdown of main user journeys}

### 5.3 Advanced features & edge cases
{Complex scenarios and error handling}

### 5.4 UI/UX requirements
{Interface and design considerations}

## 6. Technical considerations

### 6.1 Architecture overview
{High-level technical approach}

### 6.2 Integration points
{External services, APIs, third-party tools}

### 6.3 Data storage & privacy
{Database, data handling, privacy requirements}

### 6.4 Performance requirements
{Speed, scalability, reliability targets}

### 6.5 Security requirements
{Authentication, authorization, data protection}

### 6.6 Potential technical challenges
{Known risks and mitigation strategies}

## 7. Success metrics & analytics

### 7.1 User-centric metrics
{User engagement, satisfaction, retention}

### 7.2 Business metrics
{Revenue, conversion, growth metrics}

### 7.3 Technical metrics
{Performance, uptime, error rates}

### 7.4 Measurement approach
{How and when to track metrics}

## 8. Project planning

### 8.1 Project scope & estimate
{Size estimate and timeline}

### 8.2 Team composition
{Required roles and team size}

### 8.3 Risk assessment
{Identified risks and mitigation plans}

### 8.4 Dependencies
{External dependencies and blockers}

## 9. Development phases

### 9.1 Phase breakdown
{Logical development phases with deliverables}

### 9.2 MVP definition
{Minimum viable product scope}

### 9.3 Post-MVP roadmap
{Future iterations and feature additions}

## 10. User stories

{Create comprehensive user stories with this format:}

### 10.1. {user_story_title}
- **ID**: US-001
- **Description**: As a {persona}, I want to {action} so that {benefit}
- **Priority**: {High|Medium|Low}
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - {Specific, testable criteria}
  - {Edge cases and error scenarios}
  - {Performance requirements}

{Continue with all necessary user stories, ensuring complete coverage}
```

### Phase 4: TaskMaster Optimization

After generating the PRD, provide additional guidance:

**TaskMaster Integration:**
- Save the PRD to `.taskmaster/docs/prd.md` 
- Suggest running `/parse-prd` to generate tasks
- Offer to create a TaskMaster-optimized version if needed

**Quality Checklist:**
- All user stories are testable and specific
- Acceptance criteria are clear and measurable  
- Dependencies and priorities are well-defined
- Technical requirements support TaskMaster task generation

### Advanced Features

**Iterative Refinement:**
- After generating initial PRD, ask: "Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section?"
- Offer to break down complex features into more detailed user stories
- Suggest improvements based on best practices

**Multiple Output Formats:**
- Standard PRD (comprehensive documentation)
- TaskMaster-optimized PRD (focused on task generation)
- Executive summary (high-level overview)

## Best Practices

1. **Be Conversational**: Ask follow-up questions naturally
2. **Stay Focused**: Don't overwhelm with too many questions at once
3. **Be Specific**: Push for concrete details and measurable criteria
4. **Validate Understanding**: Summarize key points before moving forward
5. **Adapt to Context**: Adjust questions based on project type and complexity

## Example Interaction Flow

User: /prd Task management app for remote teams

Claude: I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD for your task management app. Let me start by understanding the core problem you're solving.

What specific challenges do remote teams currently face with task management that your app will address?

User: [Provides answer about team coordination issues]

Claude: Thanks for that context. Now let me understand your target users better. 

Can you describe your primary user persona? For example, what's their role, team size, current tools they use, and main frustrations?

[Continue iterative process...]
